[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/hxcs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/hxcs)

Support library for [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) C# backend.

It contains a build tool that is called by Haxe, discovering and calling the C# compiler on the C# code generated by Haxe. It also contains .NET 2.0, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 core assemblies that contain core .NET types and APIs.

## TODO
 * C# CFFI compatibility: be able to use unmodified .ndlls (though recompilation is needed) from hxcpp and neko in C#
